## An expense tracker

My first ReactJS app. I found that it was difficult to find expense trackers that were synchronised across the Android and iOS ecosystem. Most of them that were required some form of subscription that I was not willing to pay fow.

Having wanted to learn React for awhile now, I hence took the plunge to do a 2D1N (almost 1 night at least) hackathon to build this up and this is the end result. It's not pretty but it works (and it will get prettier with time)
